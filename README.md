# Activities
1. Applied Android Jetpack Libraries that integrate Fragment, Navigation, Animation, and other components.
2. Integrated Firebase tools to authenticate the users and used their Realtime Database to store and sync data.   
3. Used Git Bash to manage GIT Source Control and update the projects online after refactoring the code.
